A few different inspirations/motivations here

Lots of our personal data is dispersed across different social networks and cloud based apps. 
Goodreads for books, lots of different fitness apps, facebook for friends, Github for code, etc. 
The network effects and purpose built user interfaces are nice and convenient, but there are drawbacks. Privacy concerns
are an obvious downside, but having your data locked up in many different silos makes it difficult to analyze it in 
interesting ways.

For instance, the Github streak feature is a great bit of gamification. It's been an extremely effective way to motivate myself
to do at least a tiny bit of productive side work every single day. The problem is that if I'm using it to motivate me,
it provides a very limited definition of "productive work". I keep avoiding reading a physical tech book I own because it's 
not as easy to transfer notes from it to a Github repo. Other types of work like creating Anki flash cards, or coding a project
in a private Bitbucket repo, aren't reflected in the streak. Using Github as a record of my productivity is nice but limiting.

A personal analytics tool would be a useful thing to have. Like many web analytics tools, it could be implemented in a very
generic manner. At the core you'd have "events" which could represent any number of things, from reading pages in a book to
commiting code to a git repo to going on a bike ride. On top of that core, you could build interesting plugins to display
data in a domain specific way, or you could build optional integrations with existing tools to leverage their networks and
databases of information, without giving them control of your data. For instance, you might track the books you own and have
read in your personal database, but a Goodreads plugin propagates those updates to your account so you can still interact
with your friends on that site. You remain in control of your data, but you still get to enjoy the Goodreads network
without trying to reinvent the wheel. Now that all of your personal analytics data is stored in one place, you can define 
what a day of "productive work" means to you. The Github streak simply becomes a "work streak". There might be lots of other
intresting ways you can analyze your data now that it's not locked up into domain specific silos.
