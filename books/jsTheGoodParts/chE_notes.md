Appendix E. JSON
====================

JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data interchange format.

It has 6 kinds of values: objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.

JSON objects take JSON strings as keys and any JSON value as the value.

A JSON string uses double quotes. Backslash is used to escape double quotes, other backslashes, forward slashes, and control characters.

JSON numbers are like JS numbers.

JSON.parse provides a safer alternative to `eval` when consuming JSON from a remote server.
