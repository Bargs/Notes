Ch 9 Style
============

> Style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. It makes for better reading.

> I prefer to make the structure of my programs self-illuminating, eliminating the need for comments. I am not always successful, so while my programs are awaiting perfection, I am writing comments.

> When reviewing the features of a language, I now pay special attention to the features that are sometimes useful but occasionally dangerous. Those are the *worst parts* because it is difficult to tell whether they are being used correctly. That is a place where bugs hide.
