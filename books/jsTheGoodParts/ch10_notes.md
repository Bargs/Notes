Ch 10 Beautiful Features
============================

The best of the good parts:

* Functions as first class objects
* Dynamic objects with prototypal inheritance
* Object literals and array literals

Many of JS's additional features don't add much value, or even add negative value.

> We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to consumers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to product than designs that assemble long lists of features.

> We all find the good parts in the products that we use. We value simplicity, and when simplicity isnâ€™t offered to us, we make it ourselves. My microwave oven has tons of features, but the only ones I use are cook and the clock. And setting the clock is a struggle. We cope with the complexity of feature-driven design by finding and sticking with the good parts.
